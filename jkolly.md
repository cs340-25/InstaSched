# Choosing an OSS Project

### Assignment

Please describe criteria you plan to use in selecting OSS project to contribute. Please go over the these checkpoints and for each point please note if you plan to use it. Also note any additional criteria you plan to use. Please set label Ready to review once done.

## 1. Criteria

Related to the transportation field.

### Start by thinking about the projects you have already used
I plan to use this criteria
I've used a few python extensions that I would like to explore more.

### Choose the project you are very interested in
I plan to use this criteria
I'd like to find a project that has an environmental impact/sustainable usage.

### Choose the project you are familiar with
I will not focus on this criteria.
I would like to do a deeper dive into things I am not as immersed in.

### Choose the project that can be run stand alone
I will keep this criteria in mind.
I am still not sure as to what I would like to focus on, so I will see if I'd like to work on a larger project or the specific subset of another.

### Choose an active project
I plan to use this criteria;
Sustainability is all about staying recent and active. I want to edit a project that will make a difference.

### Check if the project is accepting contributions
I plan to use this criteria;
I hope to offer my help, and find a like-minded community I can continue interacting with outside class assignments.

## 2. Summary
I would like to find an open source application related to autonomous vehicle software other than carla, which I already have experience with.

# Selecting an OSS Project
Please specify OSS project you actually plan to contribute to at the end of the oss/yournetid.md.
Please note

- the projects website,
- issue tracker,
- version control system
- as well as materials it has on how to contribute (if any).
Please make sure you include a paragraph explaining how this project cotributes to social good. Please set the label Ready to review once done. Pay attention to the due date.

### 1. **Project Website**
- https://autoware.org/

### 2. **Issue Tracker**
- https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/issues

### 3. **Version Control System**
- https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware
- Uses github for version control

### 4. **Materials / Resources**
- https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/blob/main/README.md

### 5. **How does it contributes to social good?**
- It allows researchers to use autonomous vehicle stacks for research without breaking the bank. This can lead to many innovations in the autonomous vehicle industry and save many lives.

# Describing the OSS Project
Please describe OSS project selected at the end of the oss/yournetid.md.
Give a brief introduction of the project:

The project is an open source autonomous vehicle software stack. Which is a suit of softwares that operate the autonomous vehicle it handles the perception, planning, and controlling of the autonomous vehicle. It has 68 contributers and was started in 2015 by Shinpei Kato at Nagoya University. It started to gain traction in 2016 when it was selected to be used in a driverless vehicle contest hosted by TIER IV and Udacity. Since then it has been the leading open source autonomous vehicle software stack and a favorite among acadamia and industry. It has 598 total commits with its most recent 2 days ago. They have 48 open issues with most of them getting a response within a week. 

- what the project is about,
- the scale of the project (e.g., the number of contributors, LOC),
- the history of the project
- its activity (total commits, recent commits), responsiveness (median time until first response for the last 10 issues), and suitability for making contributions (is there a recent external contribution)?
Please list the reasons why you think the project is suitable for you. 

- I am interested in the transportation industry and have prior research and internship experience with autonomous vehicles.
- I have done work with other open source autonomous vehicle simulators but not with a software stack.
- This will be a valuble learning experience and skill I can transfer to my professional life.

# Select the first task
People have a lot of issues with running autoware on carla specifically getting the autonomous stack to recognize and understand traffic lights. This is due to carlas map having incomplete traffic lights.

# Develop a plan
I am going to port a single map in carla for use with autoware and create documentation on how to do so. First I will need to read the documentation on how autoware recognizes traffic lights. Then I will need to utilize a mapping program like mathworks roadrunner.
