Members: Joey Kolly, Walton Prest, Jake Miller

Introduction
This project is a user-interface application that generates a personalized schedule to fill out your day with motivational and productive suggestions
The user fills out their current schedule with class or work times, then the application delivers a schedule that starts and ends at user-designated times filled with lifestyle activities to make a productive day
We want to make people’s daily decisions easier by providing an easy way to maintain a healthy and fun lifestyle throughout the day

Customer Value
Our primary customer base would be those who want to be productive but can’t decide how to fill their day
People try to plan out their day but it can be intimidating to think of ways to stay on track with their goals, our app can make that easier
Our users will gather ideas and realize how productive they can be by just adding a few extra suggestions to their daily schedule

Proposed Solution and Technology
This program will automatically insert activities that are timed to fit around the current schedule given by the user
Using a program builder, we can create a user interface to input their schedule then the system can be recognized the times given and return a schedule based on their preferences 
System: any
Tools: Java, React, HTML
